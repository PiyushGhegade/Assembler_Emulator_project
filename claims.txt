Files:
==========
*All the files I submitted, asm.c , emu.cpp and claims.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the 3  test examples has also been uploaded. They are BubbleSort(3 output files), Custom_test1(3 output files), Custom_test2
(3 output file). All the test files have been tested and work properly.

*Both of my programs(i.e asm.c, emu.cpp) did not show any errors and warnings when i compiled it with
gcc -std=c89 -pedantic and gcc -std=c89 -pedantic -W -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings -Wstrict-prototypes standard  or equilvalent ....or gcc ... or g++

*Two programs are compilable with gcc asm.c -o asm and g++ emu.cpp -o emu.


=============================
Program format and structure:
=============================
1. The assembler:

    * with two data structures to store respectively labels and mnemonic table with expected operands.
    * uses a single routine for both passes.
    * detects label errors and syntax errors.
    * consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure. 
    * sensible variable, function & type names with explanatory comments.
		* advanced listing file.
		* assembles test programs.
	  * can implements and demonstrates the instruction SET.

2. The emulator :

		* with three data structures to store respectively memory, mnemonic table with expected operands
		  and a linked list structure word.
    * loads object file, 
    * by giving the instructions like "e" , the program can produce memory dump before execution.
    * by giving the instruction like "c", the program is executed.
    * by giving the instructions like "e" again, now the program can produce memory dump after execution.
    * detects errant programs.

Testing:
=============================

1. The assembler:

I have tested  7 examples shown as bellow. The errors only occurred in the file test2.asm and the program immediately stopped before the second pass. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files were generated : logFile.log, machinieCode.o, listCode.txt 


1)
#Input:test1.asm
#Output: 
 INFORMATION: LOG CODE GENERATED logFile.log
 WARNING: Unused label found: label at line 11
 WARNING: Halt not found
 WARNING:  Infinite loop detected at address 6 (branching to itself).
 INFORMATION: MACHINE CODE GENERATED machineCode.o
 INFORMATION: LISTING FILE GENERATED listfiles.txt


2)
#Input:test2.asm
#Output:

5)

6)
#Input:Custom_tes1.asm
#Output: 
 INFORMATION: LOG CODE GENERATED logFile.log
 INFORMATION: MACHINE CODE GENERATED machineCode.o
 INFORMATION: LISTING FILE GENERATED listfiles.txt


7)
#Input:Custom_test2.asm
#Output: 
 INFORMATION: LOG CODE GENERATED logFile.log
 INFORMATION: MACHINE CODE GENERATED machineCode.o
 INFORMATION: LISTING FILE GENERATED listfiles.txt



2. The emulator:

I have tested Six examples shown as bellow. The errors only occurred in the file test3.o and 
the program immediately stopped and the terminal window closes. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced excution data both on the screen and output text file for each example according to the usage instruction. 

After running the bin file given, the trace data are the same as 
the implemented result from my own program.

machine Code is generated in "machineCode.o" file through assmebler so each time test file is passed through assembler its machineCode.o file is generated and if already present gets overwritten. Since input file name is machineCode.o everytime thus i have removed input option and this file is opened automatically. instructions are given to use emulator.

1)
#Input: machineCode.o (test1.asm)//(already opened)
#Output: ERROR !!! Segmentation Fault 
On running the file Time Limit Exceeded due to infinite loop


2)
#Input:machineCode.o (test3.asm)//(already opened)
#Output: Fail to complete. Terminal closes


2)
#Input:machineCode.o (test4.asm)//(already opened)
#Output: (as per instructions)


4)
#Input:machineCode.o (Bubblesort.asm)//(already opened)
#Output: (as per instructions)

5)
#Input:machineCode.o (Custom_tes1.asm)//(already opened)
#Output: (as per instructions)

6)
#Input:machineCode.o (Custom_test2.asm)//(already opened)
#Output: (as per instructions)
